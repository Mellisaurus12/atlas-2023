Bread is one of the staple foods.\n\nr/Brot is the german subreddit dedicated for bread. (lit. Brot = Bread)\n\nA group of 8 friends started on friday to add among us into the bread that face each other. Later they added a heart between them with ~6 people left. Mellisaurus, one of the friends added a dinosaur to the left of the bread monday night. Later on monday they added a cookie monster to honor one of the other friends, Kruemmel. Then they turned the o of brot into a cookie and let the monster grab it. Just before the event started they added a bee into the heart and tried to clean everything up, but then only grey, white and black colors were left.",
